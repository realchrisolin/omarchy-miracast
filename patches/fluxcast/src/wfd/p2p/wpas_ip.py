"""IP-layer configuration for the raw-wpa_supplicant P2P backend (wpas.py).

Split out of wpas.py to keep each file focused. This module picks up once a
P2P group already exists: which role we ended up with, and how to get a
working IP on the resulting interface for that role.

The P2P spec doesn't guarantee who becomes Group Owner - it's negotiated,
and plenty of real-world WFD sinks expect to end up as GO themselves while
the source acts as client. When the roles land the other way around (we're
GO, the sink is client), a plain DHCP client on our side has nothing to
talk to, and NetworkManager's own path correctly self-assigns an address
with no gateway rather than pretending otherwise.

So this module detects the actual role (get_p2p_role) and branches: as GO,
serve DHCP to the sink ourselves (_run_as_go: static IP + dnsmasq); as
client, run a real DHCP client (_run_dhcp_client) against the sink's own
DHCP server.
