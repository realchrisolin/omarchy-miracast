"""Direct wpa_supplicant P2P backend.

An alternative to nm.py: instead of asking NetworkManager to bring up the
P2P link, this module talks to wpa_supplicant's own D-Bus P2PDevice
interface directly (Find, Connect, GroupStarted). NetworkManager is never
asked to manage the connection, so it stays out of the way entirely.

The payoff is control that NetworkManager's own API doesn't expose: we can
set the WFD Device Info IE and the P2P operating channel ourselves, and
watch each step of the negotiation up close when something needs debugging.

See wpas_ip.py for everything that happens once a group exists - role
detection and IP configuration live there to keep this file focused.

Discovery, GO-intent handling, and device naming already have solid
implementations elsewhere in this codebase (peers.py, device.py); this
module's job is just to drive the connection itself, replacing
_connect_peer / _wait_for_nm_activation from nm.py.
